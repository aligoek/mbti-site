          Welcome to MBTI Analyser, your innovative platform for self-discovery through advanced personality analysis. Our mission is to provide accessible and insightful tools that help individuals understand their unique strengths, preferences, and potential, all while prioritizing their privacy.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3 mt-8">Our Vision</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We believe that self-awareness is a cornerstone of personal and professional growth. By leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence, we aim to offer a fresh perspective on the well-established Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) framework, making it more engaging and relevant for the digital age.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3 mt-8">How We Do It</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Our platform utilizes a sophisticated BERT-based machine learning model, trained on a diverse dataset of text examples, to infer MBTI personality types from various input formatsâ€”be it direct text, audio, video, or images. To ensure accurate analysis, our system includes an automatic translation feature that converts non-English input into English before processing. This approach allows for a unique and objective analysis, complementing traditional self-assessment methods.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Crucially, our system is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not store any user-submitted data. All uploaded files (audio, video, images) are processed temporarily and deleted immediately after your MBTI prediction is generated. Text input is processed in memory without any persistent storage.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We are committed to continuous research and development to enhance the accuracy and reliability of our analytical tools, ensuring that you receive the most valuable insights into your personality.
        </p>
